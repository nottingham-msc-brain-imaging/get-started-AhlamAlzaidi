This shows you how to use *Markdown* to write simple text documents that can be converted into a PDF document or a webpage very easily. On http://github.com Markdown documents will automatically render nicely.

```
A couple of very easy things are to make
text *italic*, **bold** or mark it as ``code``.

A couple of very easy things are to make text *italic*, **bold** or mark it as ``code``.

If you have extended pieces of code, you can also include them and add syntax highlighting. E.g.

```matlab
% some matlab code
a = rand(64);
figure, imagesc(a), colormap(gray)
axis image
```

All you need to do this is **enclose** a block of text with three backticks: `` ``` ``. So three backticks in a line at the start, and three in a new line at the end.

You can also add a language preset (matlab, bash, c, python, ... all work) by starting a block with

```
  ```matlab
```

For running ``UNIX`` commands, we usually rely on a shell called ``bash`` (the Bourne again shell), so use that word to switch on highlighting for such code. [[Wikipedia entry for BASH]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
